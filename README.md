# Object-Oriented Design Patterns (OODP) Module

This repository contains examples and explanations for 11 fundamental Object-Oriented Design Patterns (OODP). These patterns are grouped into three main categories: **Creational Patterns**, **Structural Patterns**, and **Behavioral Patterns**.

## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on the efficient and flexible creation of objects. They abstract the instantiation process, making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

- **Singleton Design Pattern**
  - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  - Example: [Singleton Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Factory Design Pattern**
  - Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
  - Example: [Factory Example](link_to_example)

## Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition and typically help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure of the system doesn’t need to do so.

- **Adapter Design Pattern**
  - Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
  - Example: [Adapter Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Facade Design Pattern**
  - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
  - Example: [Facade Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Proxy Design Pattern**
  - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
  - Example: [Proxy Example](link_to_example)

## Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects, specifically how they interact and fulfill their responsibilities.

- **Strategy Design Pattern**
  - Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
  - Example: [Strategy Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Template Method Design Pattern**
  - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
  - Example: [Template Method Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Command Design Pattern**
  - Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
  - Example: [Command Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Iterator Design Pattern**
  - Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
  - Example: [Iterator Example](link_to_example)
  
- **State Design Pattern**
  - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
  - Example: [State Example](link_to_example)
  
- **Observer Design Pattern**
  - Allows objects to notify other objects about changes in their state, thereby allowing them to react accordingly.
  - Example: [Observer Example](link_to_example)
